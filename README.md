# nnchatbot
this is a simple chatbot that is written on python. It is based on Neural Network. It has json file that includes, tags, patterns(possible inputs by user)
and responses(number of responses by bot). Getting this information from json file, in main.py the information goes through the neural network algorithm and
the module is trained Nth number of times according to the given number. 
After training is finished, when a user types an input, the bot gives the most accurate answer from the json responses parts, and so on.
If a bot does not understand an input, it will print the "I dont get you" text.
